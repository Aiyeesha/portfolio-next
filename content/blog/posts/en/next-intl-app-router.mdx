# Next.js App Router i18n with next-intl

This tutorial explains a clean i18n setup for the **App Router** using `next-intl`.

## What you get

- `/en` and `/fr` locale prefixes
- Messages under `messages/en.json` and `messages/fr.json`
- A proxy (Next.js 16) to handle locale negotiation
- A great developer experience: strongly typed messages, clear structure, predictable routing

## Recommended structure

- `app/[locale]/...` for localized routes
- `messages/{locale}.json` for strings
- `i18n/request.ts` for configuring `next-intl`

## Common pitfalls

- Forgetting the proxy file (or using deprecated middleware)
- Not providing a default locale fallback
- Mixing server/client translations incorrectly

## Practical advice

- Keep messages **small** and **organized** (group by feature: `nav.*`, `contact.*`, `sections.*`)
- Use a single `Contact` API endpoint and forward to providers (Formspree, email service, CRM)

If you want, we can add **typed message keys** and a lint rule to catch missing translations.


## Quick commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
