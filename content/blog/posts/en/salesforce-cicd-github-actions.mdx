# Salesforce CI/CD with GitHub Actions

A pragmatic pipeline you can ship quickly and harden progressively.

## Goals

- Validate PRs (lint, tests)
- Deploy safely to target orgs
- Keep secrets secure
- Reduce “works on my machine” issues

## Suggested stages

1. **PR validation**: run unit tests + static checks
2. **UAT**: deploy to a sandbox, run smoke tests
3. **Production**: controlled deployment, manual approvals if needed

## Best practices

- Prefer **scratch orgs** or dedicated sandboxes for validation
- Use **least privilege** secrets in CI
- Add a **rollback plan** and a clear change log

We can add a real YAML example and explain each line step-by-step.
