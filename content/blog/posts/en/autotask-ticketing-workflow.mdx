## Goal

Standardize incident and request handling in **Autotask**:

- Creation/triage (email → ticket)
- Qualification (impact, urgency, category)
- **SLA** compliance (priorities, escalation)
- Traceability (notes, attachments, **time entries**)
- Clean closure (resolution, customer comms, lightweight post-mortem)

## Step 1 — Intake: from email to ticket

1. Open **Autotask**.
2. Go to **Service Desk** → **Tickets**.
3. Filter by queue: `N1 - Support` (or equivalent).
4. Confirm the email created a ticket:
   - Email subject → ticket title
   - Email body → description / initial note
   - Attachments → *Attachments* tab

**Good practices**
- One support mailbox: `support@...`
- Clear subject pattern: `[Customer] - [Service] - [Symptom]`
- Ensure *Company / Contact* mapping is correct.

## Step 2 — Qualification (≤ 3 minutes)

Open the ticket and fill:

1. **Company / Contact**
2. **Type**: Incident / Service Request / Problem
3. **Category / Subcategory**
4. **Impact**
5. **Urgency**
6. **Priority**
7. **Source** (Email, Phone, Monitoring, etc.)

### Simple Impact × Urgency matrix (example)

- High impact + High urgency → **P1**
- High impact + Medium urgency → **P2**
- Medium impact + High urgency → **P2**
- Medium impact + Medium urgency → **P3**
- Everything else → **P4**

## Step 3 — SLA: timers and escalation

1. Check which **SLA** is applied (often automatic by Company).
2. Confirm **Due Date** and/or milestones (First Response / Resolution).
3. For P1/P2:
   - Assign a **technician** immediately
   - Add “On-call” tag/flag if you use one
   - Notify internal channel per your runbook

## Step 4 — Work log: notes + time entries

### 4.1 Notes (communication)

- **Internal note**: for the team (diagnosis, hypotheses, next steps)
- **Customer note**: clear, factual, minimal jargon

**Recommended structure**

- Symptom:
- Findings:
- Actions taken:
- Result:
- Next step:

### 4.2 Time Entry (mandatory)

1. Click **New Time Entry**.
2. Fill:
   - Date / Start / End
   - Work Type (Remote/On-site)
   - Summary Notes (actionable)
3. Save.

## Step 5 — Escalation to N2 / vendor

### When to escalate

- Scope is beyond N1
- You collected evidence (logs/screenshots)
- You ran standard N1 actions (runbook)

### Escalation pack (put into the ticket)

- Context: customer, site, impact
- Timestamp + frequency
- Evidence: logs/screenshots
- Actions already tried (+ outcome)
- Hypothesis + a specific question

Then:

1. Change **Assigned Resource** to `N2` (or dedicated queue).
2. Add an internal note “ESCALATION” with the pack.
3. If vendor case is needed, add the case ID in the ticket.

## Step 6 — Closure quality

Before closing:

1. Ensure the **Resolution** field is filled.
2. Ensure customer communication is logged/sent.
3. Confirm:
   - at least one time entry
   - relevant attachments
4. Set status to **Complete / Closed**.

## Step 7 — Lightweight post-mortem (P1/P2)

Add an internal “RETEX” note:

- Root cause (if known)
- Corrective action
- Preventive action (monitoring, policy, documentation)
- Follow-up task if needed
