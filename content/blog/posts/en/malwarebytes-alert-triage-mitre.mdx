## Goal

Use a **repeatable** method to handle a Malwarebytes (Nebula / OneView) alert:

- Quickly assess severity
- Collect the right evidence (process, path, user, timeline)
- Decide: false positive vs PUP vs malware vs intrusion
- Contain then remediate
- Document (ticket + **MITRE ATT&CK** mapping)

## Step 1 — Quick triage (2–5 minutes)

1. Open the Malwarebytes console.
2. Go to **Detections / Suspicious activity**.
3. Open the event and capture:
   - Endpoint / hostname
   - User account
   - Process path + binary name
   - Detection time
   - Action taken (blocked / quarantined / allowed)
   - Severity

**Quick decision cues**

- PUP/adware on a workstation: often low/medium, standard remediation.
- Unknown executable in a suspicious path: escalate.
- MITRE tags like “Initial Access” / “Lateral Movement”: treat as high severity.

## Step 2 — Check endpoint context

1. Is it a critical server or a standard workstation?
2. Look at history:
   - recent detections
   - last seen / agent update

## Step 3 — Minimum evidence pack

Collect:

- Full binary path
- Hash (if available)
- Parent process (process tree/graph)
- Command line (if shown)
- File/network artifacts (if available)

## Step 4 — Containment (if strongly suspicious)

Depending on your capabilities:

1. Isolate the endpoint (network isolation) if available.
2. Temporarily disable the user account if compromise is likely.
3. Block IOCs:
   - hash, URL, domain
4. Notify stakeholders per internal runbook.

## Step 5 — Remediation

### PUP / adware

1. Run a full scan.
2. Quarantine/remove detections.
3. Clean:
   - browser extensions
   - installed programs
4. Check scheduled tasks and Run/RunOnce keys.

### Malware / suspicious executable

1. Quarantine/remove.
2. Reboot if required.
3. Verify:
   - persistence (services, tasks)
   - abnormal outbound connections
4. Consider reimage if confidence is low.

## Step 6 — MITRE mapping (documentation)

In your ticket, record:

- Tactic (e.g., Initial Access)
- Technique (if known)
- Rationale (what evidence supports it)

## Step 7 — Closure and prevention

- Update rules/exclusions (only if false positive is proven)
- Add correlated monitoring (RMM/SIEM)
- Maintain an N1 runbook:
  - evidence pack
  - containment steps
  - escalation criteria
