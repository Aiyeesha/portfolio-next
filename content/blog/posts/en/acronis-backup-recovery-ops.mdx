## Goal

Operate **reliable** backups with **Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud**:

- Backup plans by type (VM / servers / workstations)
- Destinations: **Cloud** and/or **local NAS (SMB)**
- Retention policy
- Alerts & daily monitoring
- Remediation for common errors

## Step 1 — Prepare destinations

### 1.1 Cloud destination

1. Open the Acronis console.
2. Select the correct tenant/customer.
3. Check Cloud quota and current usage.

### 1.2 NAS (SMB) destination

1. Validate SMB access from a test server:
   - dedicated service account
   - read/write permissions
2. Record:
   - SMB path: `smb://IP/share/folder`
   - credentials stored in a secret manager

## Step 2 — Create a backup plan

1. **Plans** → **Create plan**.
2. Name it (e.g.) `BKP-SRV-VM-DAILY`.
3. **What to back up**:
   - VMs: full machine (image) or selected disks
   - Servers: system + data volumes
   - SQL/Exchange: enable application-aware options if available
4. **Where to back up**:
   - Acronis Cloud, or
   - NAS (SMB) path + credentials
5. **Schedule** (example): Mon–Sat at 23:00
6. **Retention** (example):
   - Daily: 6 days
   - Weekly: 4 weeks
   - Monthly: 2 months
7. Save.

## Step 3 — Assign the plan to devices

1. Go to **Devices**.
2. Filter by site/group.
3. Select target machines.
4. Assign the plan (or via policy).
5. Confirm agents are online and up to date.

## Step 4 — Daily monitoring

Every day:

1. Open **Dashboard / Alerts**.
2. Work in this order:
   1. Critical
   2. Error
   3. Warning
3. For each alert:
   - identify plan + device
   - open run details

## Step 5 — Remediation: common failures

### 5.1 “Not enough space / quota exceeded”

1. Check destination capacity:
   - Cloud quota + usage
   - NAS free space + snapshots
2. Review retention (too long?).
3. Options:
   - reduce retention
   - enable compression/dedup
   - move some jobs to another storage target
4. Re-run on one test device.

### 5.2 VMware CBT / snapshots warning

1. In vCenter, check for existing/orphan snapshots.
2. Remove/consolidate during a maintenance window.
3. Re-run the job.
4. If it persists, verify VMware/Acronis settings and agent versions.

### 5.3 SMB authentication failure

1. Test SMB access from a machine: `\IP\share\path`
2. Check:
   - expired password
   - share/NTFS permissions
   - firewall (SMB 445)
3. Update credentials in Acronis, re-test.

## Step 6 — Restore validation

A backup marked “OK” is not enough: prove restore.

1. Pick one critical machine.
2. Run a restore test:
   - file restore (quick)
   - volume/VM restore (as needed)
3. Validate:
   - file integrity
   - restore time (RTO)
4. Document results (date, duration, operator, improvements).

## Day-1 checklist

- [ ] Agents online and up to date
- [ ] Realistic retention
- [ ] Cloud/NAS destinations reachable
- [ ] Alerts routed to the right team (email/PSA)
- [ ] A restore test is done and documented
